3. now once inside feel free to look around the code but the main file you are interested in is the `main.py` file, the rest is config for the docker containers and database
4. type `docker compose up` in the terminal this will spin up the application, once setup you should see the following, this means its ready to go. If you see any errors around database connections just hit `ctrl + c` and try again it should work the second time.

5. click the link `http://0.0.0.0:8000` it should take to a page like this `https://refactored-potato-7rg5vqvq7gx2p6g9-8000.app.github.dev/` add `docs` to the end and you should see a page like this, here you will see all the endpoints provided and a way to send requests to them and see the response.
